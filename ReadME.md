## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Game Rules**:

   - The game is played by **2 players**.
   - Players take turns to roll the dice.
   - The score from the dice gets added to the player's current score.
   - If a player rolls a `1`, they lose all points for that turn, and the next player takes their turn.
   - A player can **"Hold"** their score to add it to their total score.
   - The first player to reach **100 points** wins the game.

2. **Controls**:
   - Click **"Roll Dice"** to roll the dice.
   - Click **"Hold"** to save the current score.
   - Click **"New Game"** to restart the game.
